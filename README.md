# üåä AI-Driven Open Model for Predicting Orthophosphate from Water Quality Monitoring Data

## üß™ Overview

**Open Orthophosphate Model** 

***Transforming Water Quality Monitoring: AI-Driven Prediction of Orthophosphate Concentrations in River Catchments.***

## üìñ Introduction

Phosphorus chemical species serve as key indicators of nutrient pollution in aquatic systems, often measured as orthophosphate by regulators. Traditional methods of monitoring phosphorus chemical species are labour intensive and expensive. Consequently, measures of orthophosphate are spatially and temporally sparse, representing approximately 2% of all records in the Environment Agency‚Äôs (EA‚Äôs) water quality database for England over 24 years. To address this, River Deep Mountain AI has developed a predictive framework, the Open Orthophosphate Model, using AI/ML (Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning. The Open Orthophosphate Model estimates orthophosphate from other monitored water quality parameters, leveraging the water quality data collected by the EA over 24 years. The Open Orthophosphate Model integrates molecular chemistry, spatiotemporal analysis, and regulatory compliance to support scalable, cost-effective monitoring. This work helps to address environmental, regulatory, and technical gaps in water quality monitoring.

This repository hosts an AI/ML framework that predicts orthophosphate (OrthoP) levels in river surface water in England using a pre-trained LightGBM model. This model could be further developed to predict orthophosphate levels in other water body types, such as lakes/ponds/reservoirs and groundwater. The model could also be adapted to predict other chemical forms of phosphorus, such as total phosphorus.

**Key Impact**: 
Supports traditional monitoring practices by inferring orthophosphate levels using easily obtainable water quality parameters. Supports UN Sustainable Development Goal 6 (Clean Water) and the UK's Net Zero targets. üåç

## üìä Model Details
- **Algorithm**: LightGBM (Gradient Boosting Decision Tree) outperformed XGBoost, ANN (Artificial Neural Network), and linear regression.
- **Key Features**:
  - 45 most representative features for predicting orthophosphate levels. Please note that not all listed features are needed for the Open Orthophosphate Model to predict orthophosphate: the more that are provided, the more accurate the estimations of orthophosphate will be. These features include:
      - **36 Representative features identified using Machine Learning (ML) algorithms**: e.g., Ammonia, nitrate, pH, dissolved oxygen.
      - **3 Domain expert-curated features: Conductivity, precipitation, temperature.
      - **6 Regulatory features: Section 82 parameters, e.g., un-ionised ammonia, dissolved oxygen, water temperature and pH.

## üöÄ Performance Summary
- **Accuracy**: Predicts orthophosphate with Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.01 and Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.00123.**.
- **Hybrid approach**: Combines **ML identified features** (e.g., ammonia, nitrate) with domain-expert insights (e.g., conductivity, precipitation).
- **Explainable AI**: SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) framework reveals drivers such as ammonia (76% impact) and seasonal trends.
- **Scalable**: There are over 64,000 sampling points across England where water quality is being monitored by the EA. The model was trained using orthophosphate data collected from over 18,000 of these sampling points. However, the model can be applied to predict orthophosphate both at points for which some orthophosphate data exist and for points for which no orthophosphate data exist.
- **Open source**: Core algorithms are publicly available for transparency. üîç

## üìä Data Summary

The open orthophosphate modeling project harnesses an a comprehensive dataset - 24 years of water quality archives from the Environment Agency, measured at 64,000+ sampling points across England. This includes 3,261 water quality parameters ‚Äî from pH levels to nutrient concentrations‚Äîoffering a holistic view of catchment dynamics. The Environment Agency dataset was used in Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to build training data for this model. EDA data including approximately 70 million samples from 64,000+ sampling points collected during Jan-2000 until May 2024 were analysed, incorporating all water body types. Later, sample data points were restricted for river surface water (classified in the EA database as ‚ÄòRiver / Running Surface‚Äô samples) for final model consumption. Of the extensive analysis on the 3,261 water quality determinands, 45 representative determinands were selected to build the training dataset. Along with this, spatiotemporal metadata such as latitude, longitude, sampling point notation, timestamp, and additional temporal-based feature-engineered parameters were finalised. Below is the list of input parameters to the model.

    **Samples considered for the model training**:
    - This model currently considers samples only from river surface water (classified as ‚ÄòRiver / Running Surface Water‚Äô in the EA database).
    - It includes all samples under this category, including 'Reactive Monitoring Samples'.
    - The model eliminates sampling points with fewer than 100 observations over the past twenty-four years (2000 to 2024).

    **Input template**:
    - The format of the input template for obtaining orthophosphate predictions can be found in the "../03_prediction_model/templates" folder. 
    - A file named "input_template_orthop2959_pred_lgbm.csv" contains sample values for Eastings, Northings, Sampling point IDs, Purpose Names, and Unit of measure metrics are also available in the same folder.

**Output**:
Predicted orthophosphate value along with the metrics including SHAP explainable framework.

## **Key Findings, Strengths and Weaknesses**

**Key Findings**
- In England, of the 70 million water quality monitoring samples contained in the Environment Agency (EA) water quality monitoring database spanning 24 years of monitoring, phosphate (P) and orthophosphate (OrthoP) account for only 0.2% and 2% of those samples, respectively. 
- The dataset includes 70 million observations (2000-2024) from 55 rivers and 25 aquifers with 3,261 physico-chemical parameters and spatiotemporal metadata.
- Clustering: Identified 6 chemically distinct groups based on molecular similarity using Kmeans++ and agglomerative clustering. 
- Advanced techniques: Using SMILES text, Morgan Fingerprints, ChemBERTa (chemical-specific transformer), ChemDataExtractor, and PubChemPy enabled clustering of 370+ orthophosphate related determinands.
- Dimensionality reduction: PCA retained 93% variance after converting SMILES to Morgan Fingerprints (molecular bitmaps).
- Hybrid feature selection: A comprehensive hybrid approach was employed. This included incorporating feedback from domain experts, utilising advanced feature selection methods such as agglomerative clustering, and traditional correlation-based analysis, combined with multiple experiments. This approach was used to finalise the representative features.
- Exclusions: Non-reactive metals (e.g. zinc) were removed after domain expert review due to misclassification. Only ‚ÄòRiver Running / Surface Water‚Äô samples were trained in the model.
- Model performance: LightGBM model outperformed XGBoost, Random Forest, ANN and linear regression models achieving:
    - MSE 0.00123
    - MAE 0.01
    - NRMSE 8%

**Strengths** 
- Predicts orthophosphate at 72% of unmonitored locations (MAE = 0.02, NRMSE = 7%).
- Combines ML with domain expertise for actionable insights. 
- Transparent via SHAP, critical for regulatory compliance.

**Weaknesses** 
- Struggles with extreme events (Since our training data is event driven).
- Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) undefined due to zero-value observations.

**Planned validations**: 
- Different zones of mean base flow index per WFD Operational Catchments.
- Different rainfall Zones ‚Äì Wet versus Dry areas. 
- Benchmark catchments containing National River Flow Archive (NRFA) benchmark gauges. 
- Highly urbanised catchments for a few suggested WFD operational catchments.

**Extensibility**:
- The model predicts orthophosphate for a given sample dataset but currently cannot forecast based on past historical trends. However, this capability can be implemented in the future with minimal effort by changing the time lags.
- Although this model currently predicts orthophosphate, it can also be used to predict over 900 phosphorus family determinands by adjusting the target parameter. This is a core benefit of the chemical-based (Agglomerative) cluster analysis.
- The model currently predicts orthophosphate for river surface water but can be extended to predict orthophosphate in other water body types, such as lake/pond/reservoir water and groundwater.
- The model uses 2% of orthophosphate data sampled over the last 24 years (2000 to 2024) from 22,000 sampling points. However, there are 64,000 sampling points across England that the EA monitors for water quality. Hence, this model can retrospectively predict orthophosphate concentrations for the remaining 42,000 sampling points.
- The model training dataset does not currently include data in the EA water quality dataset from May 2024 onwards. This data may be used to ground truth the model.
- The model's current accuracy level is MSE - 0.00123, MAE - 0.01, and NRMSE - 8%, surpassing industry standards. (The acceptable AIML standards in general is less than 15%.)
- The model uses the SHAP framework to explain the reasons behind the predictions.
- The SHAP outcomes from this model can be integrated into a Generative AI Agentic workflow to easily obtain actionable insights and compare them with pollution incidents that occurred during the predicted orthophosphate period.
- The model uses water quality samples observed from catchments in England over the last 24 years. Therefore, it does not require additional data such as runoff, land use, or rainfall, as these effects are accurately reflected in the water quality database the model was trained with. Adding such data might cause the model to overlearn redundant information.
